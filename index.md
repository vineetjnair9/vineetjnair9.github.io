Hi! I'm Vineet J Nair, and I develop computational methods to tackle climate change and enable decarbonization, with a focus on power and energy systems problems. I have previously also worked on problems in other areas, like transportation and heavy industry. I recently graduated with a PhD in Computational Science & Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am broadly interested in all areas related to climate tech and sustainability, and I'm passionate about conducting novel research as well as exploring its practical applications. I leverage tools from various domains, including **optimization**, **machine learning & artificial intelligence**, **numerical methods**, **game theory**, **statistics**, **large-scale simulation**, and **high-performance computing**. I also have extensive industry experience through research internships at **Google X**, **Shell**, **Siemens**, **Tata Motors**, **National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL)**, and **Avangrid**.

# Research Internship Experience
- **[Tata Motors](https://www.tatamotors.com/)**: Development of machine learning-based advanced motor controllers for electric vehicle power converters. Focussed on current control, speed/position observers & pulse pattern generation.
- **[Shell](https://www.shell.com/business-customers/trading-and-supply/shell-shipping-and-maritime.html)**: Data-driven optimization and machine learning algorithms for shipping decarbonization, leveraging large amounts of geospatial and onboard sensor data. Successfully improved operational efficiency of LNG carrier vessels to reduce fuel usage, emissions, and methane slip.
- **[Google X, the Moonshot Factory](https://x.company/projects/tapestry/)**: Applied scientific machine learning (physics-informed neural networks and neural ordinary differential equations) to accelerate and improve the accuracy of numerical simulations of fast timescale dynamics of synchronous generators and inverters, to assess the transient stability of power grids.
- **[Scale AI](https://scale.com/)**: Evaluating the capabilities and limitations of frontier AI models for applications in my domains of expertise (e.g., control, optimization, power systems), as a [Human Frontier Collective Program](https://hfc.scale.com/) Fellow.
- **[Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/company/innovation/research-development.html)**: Developed a novel, hierarchical market structure to coordinate distributed energy resources and flexible demand response in the future grid, based on distributed and decentralized optimization.
- **[NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/)**: Power grid modeling & digital real-time simulation for hardware-in-the-loop validation of optimization/control algorithms
- **[Avangrid](https://www.avangrid.com/)**: Developed a hybrid, federated software architecture & decision-making method to enhance cybersecurity & interoperability of a new distributed energy resources management system (DERMS) pilot.
- **[Catalyst Investment Management](https://catalystpe.com/)**: Techno-economic analysis and optimization of sustainable AI data centers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
