Hi! I am a final PhD Candidate in Computational Science & Mechanical Engineering at MIT, working with Dr. Anuradha Annaswamy. I apply optimization algorithms, control and game theory, numerical methods, and machine learning to power grids, energy systems, electricity market design, and transportation networks. Broadly, I'm passionate about developing computational tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation, clean energy, sustainability & environmental justice. You can learn more about my educational and work experiences [here](https://vineetjnair9.github.io/cv/) and a list of publications [here](https://vineetjnair9.github.io/publications/). I am currently on the job market for 2025-26, I'm open to roles in either academia or industrial research. Please email me if you would like to discuss potential opportunities.
