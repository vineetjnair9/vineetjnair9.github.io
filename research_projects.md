# PhD Research Overview

My PhD thesis at MIT was titled “Coordination of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) for a reliable, resilient, and affordable decarbonized grid. For this work, I was also awarded the Aarav Amar Bajpayee Memorial Prize for Graduate Student Societal Impact by the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, recognizing my research related to the health of the planet & global energy sustainability.

In my PhD, I applied various tools, including distributed & decentralized optimization, game theory, market design & machine learning, to solve challenging planning & operational problems for the future power grid rich in renewables, battery storage & flexible demand (electric vehicles, heat pumps, data centers). I showed that coordinating flexible DERs can significantly lower network costs, losses & consumer electricity prices. I also applied our methods to improve efficiency, hosting capacity, power quality & grid resilience to cyber-physical attacks or outages. You can find my PhD thesis defense slides below:

Beyond my thesis, I got the opportunity to work on side projects related to transmission grid modernization, physics-informed neural networks and neural differential equations, timeseries forecasting & blockchain-based frameworks for energy markets. I also enjoyed supervising & mentoring students on projects related to (i) distributed model predictive voltage control, (ii) accurate valuation of energy storage in markets under uncertainty, and (iii) understanding impacts of socioeconomic factors on the distribution of DERs in the United States.

# A few other selected projects

**Learning Dynamical Models through Data Science**

Here, we compared different data-driven approaches to learn and approximate models of dynamical systems. Specifically, (i) PDE-FIND, which is a method for partial differential equation discovery using sparse regression, and (ii) Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) based on Koopman operator theory.

**Increasing the Accuracy of Intra-day Stock Return Predictions Using Textual Information**

Here, we leveraged additional textual information using natural language processing, in addition to quantitative data. We applied various statistical regression and machine learning methods to improve prediction accuracy.
