# About Me

Hi! I'm Vineet J Nair, and I develop computational methods to tackle climate change and enable decarbonization, with a focus on power and energy systems problems. I have previously also worked on problems in other areas like transportation and heavy industry. I recently graduated with a PhD in Computational Science & Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am broadly interested in all areas related to climate tech and sustainability, and I'm passionate about conducting novel research as well as exploring its practical applications. I leverage tools from various domains, including optimization, machine learning & artificial intelligence, numerical methods, game theory, statistics, large-scale simulation, and high-performance computing. I also have extensive industry experience, through research internships at Google X, Shell, Siemens, Tata Motors, and Avangrid.
