Welcome to my new website! I've simplified the design to focus on content rather than configuration.

This is an example blog post. Posts are stored in the `_posts` folder with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

## Features

- Clean, minimal design
- Easy to update - just edit markdown files
- No CSV files needed for publications
- Fast and responsive

## Next Steps

I'll be adding:
- My publications
- Detailed CV
- Research updates

Stay tuned!
